// GameManager.cs
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The "brain" of the game. It owns:
//   - the game state (Start -> Playing -> Won or Lost)
//   - score, combo and player health
//   - the run's statistics (accuracy, speed, best combo...) for the end screen
//   - starting the game and restarting (reloading the scene)
//   - pausing (Esc) and resuming with a 3-2-1 countdown. While paused,
//     Time.timeScale is 0, so everything that uses game time (movement, spawn
//     timers, boss attacks) freezes; the countdown uses real time.
//
// THE COMBO: +1 for every kill, -1 on a wrong key, back to 1 when you get hurt.
// Each kill is worth 10 x combo points, and every 5 kills in a row earn a
// power charge (lure bomb or freeze, see Powers). So clean typing pays twice.
//
// Other scripts reach it through GameManager.Instance, for example:
//   GameManager.Instance.AddKill();
//   if (GameManager.Instance.State == GameState.Playing) { ... }
//
// The references below (hud, spawner, powers, typing) are wired in the scene.
