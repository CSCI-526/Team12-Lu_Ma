// CameraDirector.cs
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The player's "head". Lives on the Main Camera, which is a child of the
// Player rig at eye height. RailMover turns the whole rig toward where it
// rides and toward each fight; this script adds, on top of that (in the
// camera's LOCAL rotation, position and field of view):
//
//   - FOCUS: like in The Typing of the Dead, the view turns a little toward
//     the enemy whose word is being typed (clamped, so it never swings too
//     far) and glides back to straight ahead when there is nothing to type.
//     With no word started, a zombie that comes close (idleFocusDistance)
//     pulls the view gently toward it, so the player notices the threat.
//   - SHAKE:     CameraDirector.Shake(0.5f);   explosions, hits ("trauma" 0..1)
//   - KICK:      CameraDirector.Kick(1f);      every shot tips the view up a bit
//   - a running head-bob between fights, and a slow breathing sway all the time.
//   - WIDE VIEW: while the player aims a lure bomb (holds 1) or types a word,
//     the field of view widens (wideFieldOfView), so more of the fight is seen.
//   - on the Start panel and the results screens the view drifts slowly
//     left and right, so the scene behind the panel feels alive.
//   - MAP VIEW (waves 2 and 4, see WaveSpawner.mapViewWaves): once the player
//     stops at such a fight, the camera rises out of the head, pulls back and
//     tilts down until it sees the WHOLE area: every spawn point and its
//     exit, barrels, crates and every zombie. The player's green body (only
//     shown in this view) sits at the bottom centre of the screen. When the
//     ride to the next fight starts, it glides back into the eyes.
//
// Any script can call the static methods (Shake, Kick). They do nothing if
// there is no CameraDirector in the scene. Gameplay that needs "where the
// player is" uses PlayerEye / ShotOrigin, never the camera's position,
// because in the map view the camera is high above the player.
//
// Everything happens in LateUpdate, after every Update has moved the rig and
// the enemies. DefaultExecutionOrder(-100) makes it run BEFORE the other
// LateUpdates, so the words on the HUD use this frame's view.
//
// Pause: everything moves with Time.deltaTime, which is 0 while the game is
// paused, so the view holds perfectly still behind the pause panel.
