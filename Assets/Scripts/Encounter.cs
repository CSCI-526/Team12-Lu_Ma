// Encounter.cs
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// One fight in the level: a place where the player stops and zombies come at
// them (Typing of the Dead style). Every fight is an object under
// "Level > Fights" in the scene, and Level plays them in the order of its
// Encounters list. For each fight, WaveSpawner:
//
//   1. runs the player through the Route points to the Stop, and turns them
//      to face where the Stop's blue arrow (forward) points,
//   2. starts the fight: zombies come out of this fight's spawn points (or the
//      boss appears at Boss Stand), and its barrels and crates can be typed,
//   3. when every zombie is dead, opens the Exit Gate: the run goes on.
//
// Everything under this object with a SpawnPoint, Barrel or SupplyCrate
// component belongs to this fight. To add a barrel, drag the Barrel prefab
// onto this object in the Hierarchy and move it where you want it.
//
// In the Scene view, a fight draws itself (see OnDrawGizmos): the stop and
// where the player faces in green, each zombie's walk to the player in red,
// and the boss's space in magenta. Level draws the run between fights.
