// SpawnPoint.cs
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A place zombies come out of: a doorway, the end of a walk, an arcade...
// A zombie appears where this object is (out of sight, for example just
// inside a building), walks to Exit (just outside), then heads straight for
// the player. If the spawn point has a Door, it bursts open when the first
// zombie comes out.
//
// Put spawn points under a fight (an Encounter): they belong to that fight.
// Usual setup in the Hierarchy:
//   SCI front door      (this component, placed just inside the building)
//     Exit              (an empty object just outside the door)
//     Door              (the Door prefab, on the building's face)
//
// Keep the straight line from Exit to the fight's stop free of walls, because
// zombies walk straight (they do not path-find). The Scene view draws these
// walks as red lines.
