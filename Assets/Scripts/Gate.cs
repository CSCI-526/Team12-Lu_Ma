// Gate.cs
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A gate between two fights: a plain box that blocks the way until the fight
// is won. Then WaveSpawner calls Open() and it sinks into the floor, and the
// player runs over it.
//
// It is a prefab (Assets/Prefabs/Gate): place it on the ground across the
// way, with its blue arrow (forward) pointing along the run. To make it wider,
// change the X scale of its Panel. To make it taller, set the Panel's Y scale
// to the height and its Y position to half of that (change the Panel, not the
// Gate itself).
// Drag it into the fight's Exit Gate field.
